## Quick Start Guide

The repository is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the package manager.

**To start the app:**
- `npm install`
- To run the API server: `npm run start` (by default this starts on [localhost:9090](localhost:9090))

This will run it on [localhost:9090](localhost:9090)

**Other useful commands:**

- To run the unit tests: `npm run unit-test` to run the unit tests (and coverage).
- To run tests in preparation for the integration tests: `npm run integration`.
- To run the linter: `npm run lint`.
- To fix up lint errors: `npm run lint-fix`.
