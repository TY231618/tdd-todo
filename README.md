# TDD Todo List

As of yet all my react/redux app have lacked testing so I decided to delve straight into some TDD.  This app was built using proper TDD... failing test first, implement some functionality to get it passing and then refactor.

## Quick Start Guide

The repository is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the package manager.

**To start the app:**
- To install dependencies, run: `npm install`
- To run: `npm run start` (by default this starts on [localhost:8081](localhost:8081))

## Vision

TDD in React Redux, so testing components, actions and reducers.  Also E2E tests to test a full flow of the creating and deleting a todo

## What I learnt

* TDD for a basic component (test it exists)
* TDD for a smart component and the data it passes
* TDD an action creator
* TDD a reducer
* E2E tests using selenium
